# `az aro` Python development

There are currently two codebases for the `az aro` command:

* The [downstream](https://github.com/Azure/ARO-RP/tree/master/python/az/aro) `az
  aro` extension in this repo

* The
  [upstream](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/tree/dev/src/azure-cli/azure/cli/command_modules/aro)
  `az aro` module.

The upstream `az aro` command module is distributed with `az` and is
automatically present in the Azure cloud shell. Development/maintenance of this
module within the Azure CLI is handled the same as any other first-party Azure
CLI module. You can read more about how command modules are authored and
maintained [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/tree/dev/doc/authoring_command_modules).

The downstream extension can be installed by an end user to override the module
(e.g. to use preview features).  We also use the extension directly from this
codebase for development and testing of new API versions.  Customers are
advised to use the upstream CLI. You can read more about how extensions are
authored [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/extensions/authoring.md),
and some of the differences between extensions and command modules
[here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/extensions/faq.md).


We aim for the upstream and downstream codebase to be as closely in sync as
possible.


## Dev environment setup for the `az aro` command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli.git
cd azure-cli

python3 -m venv env
. ./env/bin/activate
pip install azdev
azdev setup -c
```

The `az aro` command is located in `src/azure-cli/azure/cli/command_modules/aro`
with tests in corresponding `tests` folder.


## Dev environment setup for the `az aro` extension

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/ARO-RP.git
cd ARO-RP

make pyenv
```

The `az aro` extension is located in `python/az/aro/azext_aro` with tests in
corresponding `tests` folder.

There is a very useful guide for authoring commands in the
[azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/tree/dev/doc/authoring_command_modules)
repository.


## Tests

Tests can be run as follows:

```bash
azdev test aro (--live) (--lf) (--verbose) (--debug)
```

> An issue was discovered on macOS when running tests due to additional security to restrict multithreading in macOS High Sierra and later versions of macOS. \
If getting the following error:\
`+[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.`\
Add this variable to your env or add it to your profile to make it permanent in `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`:\
`export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES`


There are two main types of tests:

* live tests that get recorded and replayed
* mocks

The guide for writing and operating the tests is in the
[azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/authoring_tests.md)
repository.


### Live tests and recording

Tests can be recorded live, which enables the next run to take place against the
recorded values.  For the recording, the Python VCR library is used; recorded
"tapes" are stored in
`src/azure-cli/azure/cli/command_modules/aro/tests/latest/recordings`.

When the `--live` flag is passed, the tests run against the Azure API and are
recorded.  Failed tests can be re-run using the `--lf` flag.

Recorded tests are run when the `--live` flag is not passed.

## Contributing

Changes made to the `az aro` command will be made to `Azure/ARO-RP` **before**
being contributed
[upstream](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/tree/dev/src/azure-cli/azure/cli/command_modules/aro).
This will allow synchronization between the two repositories to be consistent.
Once changes are made and approved to
[downstream](https://github.com/Azure/ARO-RP/tree/master/python/az/aro), pull
requests to upstream can then be opened.

When contributing to the `az aro` command upstream, imports will be different
for testing. When submitting pull requests, tests that include `azdev style`,
`azdev linter`, and `azdev test aro` should pass to ensure that changes will not
impact CI pipelines.

Additional instructions for merging changes upstream are contained in internal
documentation.

## Caveats

* `azure-cli` CI is not entirely isolated.  Test runs may pass or fail depending
  on the state of `dev` branch.  Force push to rerun the tests.

* Pulling `azure-cli` can break the `venv`.  If this happens, delete and
  recreate it.

* Care needs to be taken when designing tests for live recording.  The recording
  framework rewrites some fields, possibly including UUIDs.

* When developing the `az aro` extension in this repository, you may wish to use
  the [edge](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli#edge-builds) CLI version to be
  as close as possible to azure-cli master.
