# Upstream differences

This file catalogues the differences of install approach between ARO and
upstream OCP.


## Installer carry patches

* CARRY: HACK: remove dependency on github.com/openshift/installer/pkg/terraform
  from pkg/asset/cluster

  This enables dep to import the installer as a library as well as significantly
  decreasing compilation time and binary footprint.

* CARRY: PARTIAL: allow platform credentials to be prepopulated in
  installconfig.PlatformCreds

  This avoids the installer going to disk to fetch the credentials, enabling one
  installer to handle multiple cluster installations simultaneously.

* CARRY: allow end user to specify Azure resource group on cluster creation

  This allows the RP to specify the cluster's resource group.  TODO: reduce the
  scope of this patch to get this upstream; don't allow end-users to choose
  their cluster resource group.

* CARRY: HACK: don't use managed identity on ARO

  At the moment OCP on Azure uses MSI for kubelets and controllers and one or
  more service principals for operators.  For now on ARO, simplify to all
  components using the user-provided SP.  Later, we'll reinstate a separate
  managed identity at least for worker kubelets.

* CARRY: HACK: don't set public DNS zone on DNS CRD in ARO

  In ARO, the public DNS zone is maintained by the service and the cluster
  operator does not have permissions to modify it.

* CARRY: HACK: disable CloudProviderRateLimit

  Enabling CloudProviderRateLimit seems to get us into serious problems with the
  LoadBalancer reconciliation logic.

* CARRY: allow VM image to be overriden

  This commit enables ARO to use platform-published VM images.

* CARRY: HACK: insert worker VMs into aro load balancer backend

  This ensures that worker VMs are always in the aro load balancer backend, and
  are thus always eligible for the associated outbound rule, and thus should
  have internet access.  As a result a fake inbound service is not necessary.

* CARRY: HACK: don't require BaseDomainResourceGroupName on ARO

  This prevents a validating failure when omitting a configurable which is never
  used in ARO.


## Installation differences

* ARO persists the install graph in the cluster storage account in a new "aro"
  container / "graph" blob.

* No managed identity (for now).

* installconfig.ClusterID.InfraID is hard-coded to "aro".

* API server public IP domain name label is not set.

* ARO uses first party RHCOS OS images published by Microsoft.

* ARO API server internal LB remains on highest available master subnet IP, like
  in 4.2.

* ARO never creates aro-bootstrap-pip for bootstrap VM.

* ARO API server LB uses Azure outboundRule rather than port 27627 inbound rule.

* `aro` LB uses Azure outboundRule and outbound IP `aro-outbound-pip`.

* ARO deploys a private link service in order for the RP to be able to
  communicate with the cluster.
