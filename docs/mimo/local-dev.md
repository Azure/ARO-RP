# Local Development

1. Ensure that you have remade your databases (so that you have the MIMO ones), see [Prepare Your Dev Environment](../prepare-your-dev-environment.md).
1. Run the local RP as usual.
1. Run `make runlocal-actuator` to spawn the actuator.
1. Perform queries against the Admin API to queue/monitor MIMO manifests.
