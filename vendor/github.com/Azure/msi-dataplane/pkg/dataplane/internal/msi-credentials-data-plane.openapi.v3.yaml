  title: Managed Identity Data Plane API
  description: "API for getting credentials from managed identity resource provider\
    \ (MIRP). The endpoint and AzureResourceId are already included in the x-ms-identity-url\
    \ header from ARM. The x-ms-identity-url header also defaults to the /credentials\
    \ path. x-ms-identity-url and the system asisgned client_secret_url are interchangeable.\
    \ The x-ms-identity-url header from ARM contains the client_secret_url by default.\
    \ MIRP will return a client_secret_url per identity, client_secret_urls should\
    \ be used to rotate each identity individually. Note the client_secret_url/x-ms-identity-url\
    \ will come with query parameters included, you must take care to not remove these\
    \ when adding the api-version. The authentication_endpoint field is provided for\
    \ MSI Regional Isolation to avoid cross region calls. It will return you either\
    \ Regional AAD authentication endpoint or global AAD authentication endpoint based\
    \ on the Regional ESTS roll out status. Please follow the guidance https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureMSI/EVMqSPAdF2RBrStIe6IcdmsBW58XEeOps3xo_knU3Zen0Q?e=EK7oCU"
