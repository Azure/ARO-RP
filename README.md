## Quickstarts

* If you are an end user and want to create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4
  cluster, follow [Create, access, and manage an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4
  Cluster][1].

* If you want to deploy a development RP, follow [deploy development
  RP](docs/deploy-development-rp.md).

## Repository map

* .pipelines: CI workflows using Azure pipelines.

* cmd/aro: RP entrypoint.

* deploy: ARM templates to deploy RP in development and production.

* docs: Documentation.

* hack: Build scripts and utilities.

* pkg: RP source code:

  * pkg/api: RP internal and external API definitions.

  * pkg/backend: RP backend workers.

  * pkg/bootstraplogging: Bootstrap logging configuration

  * pkg/client: Autogenerated ARO service Go client.

  * pkg/cluster: Cluster create/update/delete operations wrapper for OCP installer.

  * pkg/database: RP CosmosDB wrapper layer.

  * pkg/deploy: /deploy ARM template generation code.

  * pkg/env: RP environment-specific shims for running in production,
    development or test

  * pkg/frontend: RP frontend webserver.

  * pkg/metrics: Handles RP metrics via statsd.

  * pkg/mirror: OpenShift release mirror tooling.

  * pkg/monitor: Monitors running clusters.

  * pkg/operator/controllers: A list of controllers instantiated by the operator
    component.

    * alertwebhook: Ensures that the receiver endpoint defined in the
      `alertmanager-main` secret matches the webserver endpoint at
      aro-operator-master.openshift-azure-operator:8080, to avoid the
      `AlertmanagerReceiversNotConfigured` warning.


    * checker: Watches the `Cluster` resource for changes and updates conditions
      of the resource based on checks mentioned below

      * internetchecker: validate outbound internet connectivity to the nodes

      * serviceprincipalchecker: validate cluster service principal has the
        correct role/permissions

    * clusteroperatoraro: Ensures that the ARO cluster object is consistent and
      immutable

    * dnsmasq: Ensures that a dnsmasq systemd service is defined as a machineconfig for all
      nodes. The dnsmasq config contains records for azure load balancers such as api, api-int and *.apps domains so they will resolve even if custom DNS on the VNET is set.

    * genevalogging: Ensures all the Geneva logging resources in the
      `openshift-azure-logging` namespace matches the pre-defined specification
      found in `pkg/operator/controllers/genevalogging/genevalogging.go`.

    * imageconfig: Ensures that required registries are not blocked in `image.config`

    * machine: validate machine objects have the correct provider spec,
      vm type, vm image, disk size, three master nodes exist, and the number of worker nodes
      match the desired worker replicas

    * machineset: Ensures that a minimum of two worker replicas are met.

    * monitoring: Ensures that the OpenShift monitoring configuration in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace is consistent and immutable.

    * node: Force deletes pods when a node fails to drain for 1 hour.  It should clear up any pods that refuse to be evicted on a drain due to violating a pod disruption budget.

    * pullsecret: Ensures that the ACR credentials in the
      `openshift-config/pull-secret` secret match those in the
      `openshift/azure-operator/cluster` secret.

    * rbac: Ensures that the `aro-sre` clusterrole and clusterrolebinding exist and are consistent.

    * routefix: Ensures all the routefix resources in the namespace
      `openshift-azure-routefix` remain on the cluster.

    * subnets: Ensures that the Network Security Groups (NSGs) are correct, and updates the Azure Machine Provider spec with subnet, vnet, and Network Resource Group.

    * workaround: Applies a set of temporay workarounds to the ARO cluster.

    * previewfeature: Allows toggling certain features that are not yet enabled by default.

  * pkg/portal: Portal for running promql queries against a cluster or requesting a kubeconfig for a cluster.

  * pkg/proxy: Proxy service for portal kubeconfig cluster access.

  * pkg/swagger: Swagger specification generation code.

  * pkg/util: Utility libraries.

* python: Autogenerated ARO service Python client and `az aro` client extension.

* swagger: Autogenerated ARO service Swagger specification.

* test: End-to-end tests.

* vendor: Vendored Go libraries.


## Basic architecture

* pkg/frontend is intended to become a spec-compliant RP web server.  It is
  backed by CosmosDB.  Incoming PUT/DELETE requests are written to the database
  with an non-terminal (Updating/Deleting) provisioningState.

* pkg/backend reads documents with non-terminal provisioningStates,
  asynchronously updates them and finally updates document with a terminal
  provisioningState (Succeeded/Failed).  The backend updates the document with a
  heartbeat - if this fails, the document will be picked up by a different
  worker.

* As CosmosDB does not support document patch, care is taken to correctly pass
  through any fields in the internal model which the reader is unaware of (see
  `github.com/ugorji/go/codec.MissingFielder`).  This is intended to help in
  upgrade cases and (in the future) with multiple microservices reading from the
  database in parallel.

* Care is taken to correctly use optimistic concurrency to avoid document
  corruption through concurrent writes (see `RetryOnPreconditionFailed`).

* The pkg/api architecture differs somewhat from
  `github.com/openshift/openshift-azure`: the intention is to fix the broken
  merge semantics and try pushing validation into the versioned APIs to improve
  error reporting.

* Everything is intended to be crash/restart/upgrade-safe, horizontally
  scaleable, upgradeable...
