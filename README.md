## Basic architecture

* pkg/frontend is intended to become a spec-compliant RP web server.  It is
  backed by CosmosDB.  Incoming PUT/DELETE requests are written to the database
  with an non-terminal (Updating/Deleting) provisioningState.

* pkg/backend reads documents with non-terminal provisioningStates,
  asynchronously updates them and finally updates document with a terminal
  provisioningState (Succeeded/Failed).  The backend updates the document with a
  heartbeat - if this fails, the document will be picked up by a different
  worker.

* As CosmosDB does not support document patch, care is taken to correctly pass
  through any fields in the internal model which the reader is unaware of (see
  `github.com/ugorji/go/codec.MissingFielder`).  This is intended to help in
  upgrade cases and (in the future) with multiple microservices reading from the
  database in parallel.

* Care is taken to correctly use optimistic concurrency to avoid document
  corruption through concurrent writes (see `RetryOnPreconditionFailed`).

* The pkg/api architecture differs somewhat from
  `github.com/openshift/openshift-azure`: the intention is to fix the broken
  merge semantics and try pushing validation into the versioned APIs to improve
  error reporting.

* Everything is intended to be crash/restart/upgrade-safe, horizontally
  scaleable, upgradeable...
